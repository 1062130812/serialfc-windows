SRS_FIRM_RS644S_CAP_REQ_01 - Message-Word Management
 This is now configured using the FLR register for variable length frames. Your 
 custom driver will be pre-configured to send 32 bit data frames. Each
 transmission will wait until the full 4 characters are added to the FIFO.

SRS_FIRM_RS644S_CAP_REQ_02 - Baud-rate
 The range of data rates is already supported by our card, but the default rate has
 changed to 16 MHz by setting the clock rate to 64 MHz and the sampling rate to
 4.

SRS_FIRM_RS644S_CAP_REQ_03 - Isochronous mode
 We have added a wrapper function and IOCTL calls around our typical 
 isochronous mode.

 IOCTL_THALES_ENABLE_MASTER_MODE - disables isochronous mode
 IOCTL_THALES_ENABLE_SLAVE_MODE - enables our isochronous mode 8

 When in slave mode, you will transmit and receive using the external
 clock supplied to the RI pin.
 
 If you apply an external clock to the card before turning on slave mode
 your system will freeze due to too many serial interrupts on the RI pin. 
 Make sure to apply the clock after you are already in slave mode (so the 
 interrupts are disabled).

SRS_FIRM_RS644S_CAP_REQ_04 - Message frequency
 The firmware is built to send data out sequentially without delay. The only
 bottle neck will be OS dependent. With your custom RTOS driver the firmware
 will be able to transmit as quickly as the data is supplied.

SRS_FIRM_RS644S_CAP_REQ_05 - Read/Reception FIFO
 This value can be read using the RFL register and the 950 interface. An
 example can be seen in the Windows source code (ThalesGetRFL() in the Windows
 driver).

SRS_FIRM_RS644S_CAP_REQ_06 - Write/Transmission FIFO
 This value can be read using the TFL register and the 950 interface. An
 example can be seen in the Windows source code (ThalesGetTFL() in the Windows
 driver).

SRS_FIRM_RS644S_CAP_REQ_07 - Synchronized transmission
 This is now configured using the EXT{H} registers, IOCTL's or C functions.
 It allows you to specify the number of "frames" that will be transmitted when
 there is a toggle on the FSR pins. Set this value to 1 if you want one
 32-bit frame to be sent when the signal event happens.
 
 IOCTL_FASTCOM_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_TRANSMIT
 IOCTL_FASTCOM_DISABLE_EXTERNAL_TRANSMIT

SRS_FIRM_RS644S_CAP_REQ_08 - Registers
 The firmware exposes the full 16950 UART register set with some additional
 registers for extra features. If an additional register is used it will
 be described in the respective requirements description.

SRS_FIRM_RS644S_INST_REQ_01 - Linux driver
 https://github.com/commtech/serialfc-linux/tree/thales-mod
 This is a branch of our mainline driver. It contains all of the Thales
 specific code.

SRS_FIRM_RS644S_INST_REQ_01 - Windows driver
 https://github.com/commtech/serialfc-windows/tree/thales-mod
 This is a branch of our mainline driver. It contains all of the Thales
 specific code.
